IDL programm to create the ouput WG15 file.


There are 4 programs which are executed sequentially. 

1) GES_WG15_iDR3_Homogenisation
Combine the results from the different working groups.

2) apply_offsets_iDR3

Apply the offsets in [Fe/H] between steup found by WG15

3) check_pars
Add in the extension the infos concerning the available parameters

4) check_vrad
 apply the vrad offsets


               GES_WG15_iDR3_Homogenisation
              ______________________________


- reads the masterlist and creates the list of the cnames.
- reads the recommended files from the WG 10 to 14.
- read the list of benchmarck stars and clean the masterlist file from the
  benchmark stars

- propagates the WG14 flags to all files

- add  WG15 extension to the benchmark stars file and removes the abundances. 

- work  with WG11
  	- adding the extension
	- removing the benchmark stars
	- apply the vrad (obsolete) => done in apply_vrad
        - update WG14 flags

- work with WG10
  	- adding the extension
	- removing the benchmark stars
	- apply the vrad (obsolete) => done in apply_vrad
        - update WG14 flags

- work with WG12
  	- adding the extension
	- removing the benchmark stars
	- apply the vrad (obsolete) => done in apply_vrad
        - update WG14 flags

- work with WG13
  	- adding the extension
	- removing the benchmark stars
	- apply the vrad (obsolete) => done in apply_vrad
        - update WG14 flags

- work with Skymapper Stars
  	- adding the extension
	- removing the benchmark stars
	- apply the vrad (obsolete) => done in apply_vrad
        - update WG14 flags

Work with stars in common between WGs
        - adding the extension
	- apply the vrad (obsolete) => done in apply_vrad
        - apply the rules set by the WG15.
	  	i.e. if Filename = gir_08* then select WG12
                     if Filename = gir_18* then select WG10

Removing cnames in double.

Creating files with :
	 - WG results without benchmark stars
         - files with stars in common



                   check_pars
                   __________

Checking if the AVAILABLE_PAR is complete


                  apply_offsets_iDR3
                  __________________


Apply the offsets following WG15 results
Merging the individual files into a single one

Clean the output file from  GES_WG15_iDR3_Homoegenisation

      - removing cnames which are already in files containing star with 
        results in two WGs.
      - adding GES type


                 check_iDR3_vrad
		 _______________

Applyign the vrad following the rules defined by WG15
