PLOTS REQUIRED FOR EACH WORKING GROUP:

# What are the values for the Sun and 18 Sco?
- Box plots for each Node (x-axis) showing Temperature points for the Sun
- Box plots for each Node (x-axis) showing logg measurements for the Sun
- Box plots for each node (x-axis) showing [Fe/H] measurements for the Sun
- Box plots for each node (x-axis) showing Temperature measurements for 18 Sco
- Box plots for each node (x-axis) showing logg measurements for 18 Sco
- Box plots for each node (x-axis) showing [Fe/H] measurements for 18 Sco 

# Are the results different depending on the setup?
# Use all stars that are observed with multiple setups.
- Temperature vs (diff in temperature between setups, each combination in it's own axes) -- here all nodes could be put on the same plot.
- Surface gravity vs (diff in surface gravity between setups, each combination in it's own axes) -- here all nodes could be put on the same plot
- Metallicity vs (diff in metallicity between setups, each combination in it's own axes) -- here all nodes could be put on the same plot
- [alpha/M] ???

# Is there any systematic bias in a parameter for any node? [use all nodes on the same plot]
# Note: Fit a line with linear regression, display median, etc all on plot.
- Temperature vs (temperature - reference_temperature) for all benchmark stars
- logg vs (logg - reference_logg) for all benchmark stars
